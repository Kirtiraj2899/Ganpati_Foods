      <p>
        Founded in the year 2007 by Mr.Ranjeet Kumar sahu and his wife
        Mrs.Supriya Ranjit Kumar Sahu, Ganpati foods provide with fresh
        dairy products at your doorstep or shopstep. We started it to
        provide a solution to people who are looking for wholesale dairy
        products, healthier versions, and even lesser chemical content in
        their dairy routine. <br/>We take pride in the fact that we donâ€™t let
        contamination and compromises come in the way of the Dairy Product
        Distribution. Starting from a small township in Pune, today we serve
        customers all across Pune. Our vision turned into our passion to
        provide services to the shops and customers looking for high quality
        and fresh Dairy Products.
